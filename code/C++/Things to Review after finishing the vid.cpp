Things to Review after finishing the video:
    Creating a program and printing a line of code
    creating and assigning variables as int, double, or any others, as well as const.
    Changing and understanding variables using mathematical expressions (+ - / * % --x ++x x++ x--)
    Printing  multiple things on the same line ("x = 10") and printing multiple things on different lines (X= 10), (y = 20), ending the line for printing the other parts.
