                                                                BASIC STARTING OUTLINE:
                                            THIS OUTLINE COVERS A PLOIT FOR A HOLLOW KNIGHT FAN GAME; I WOULD HAVE TO HANGE MANY, MANY THINGS TO PUBLISH ONLINE
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Protagonist: Follows the plot and life of The Hollow Knight (the Pure Vessel), the final boss of the original game.

Prologue: Begins with a simple animation of the Pale King creating all of his Kin.

A lore poem of similar quality to the one that begins the story of Hollow Knight will appear.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Tutorial / Beginning Area (The Abyss):

The player starts at the bottom of the Abyss and must climb out.

Movement Tutorial: Teaches the the player the basics of the game:

Teaches how to swing the nail, demonstrated by "pogoing" off of another Sibling knight, and how to jump

The Ledge Cutscene:

At the top of the Abyss, a sequence plays where the Pale King grants the King's Brand to the protagonist.

The original cinematic plays where the Knight (player character from the original game) hangs onto the ledge.

Player Interaction: If the player tries to turn around to help the falling Knight, after one step, a thought from the King's Brand appears telling the player that they must take this path alone.

Any further input (in any direction) forces the protagonist to walk forward, watching the other Knight fall.

The Sealing: * An animation plays of the Pale King reaching toward the Abyss.

With an animation of a flash, it is sealed into an indestructible wall, guarded by two members of the Royal Guard, each guard will have dialog if interacted with

Open Exploration: * The Pale King tells the protagonist to follow him (using the game's signature dialogue style) and exits.

From this point, the player is given full control to explore and progress the story as they choose, with the exception of going back tothe abyss, which will be available to explore deeper parts of the story later.

Core Game Mechanics:
    The Charm System: The game retains the classic Charm mechanic since it takes place in the same kingdom, though many Charms are reworked to align with the Pure Vessel’s unique skills and late-game abilities.

    Vessel Growth & Progression: * The Vessel begins in a small "baby form" (the size seen in the Abyss flashback).

    As the player completes plot sequences and parkour/combat challenges, the Vessel physically grows and matures until it becomes the Pure Vessel.

    Royal Guard Ranking: * Rising through the ranks of the Five Great Knights and the White Defender is a central plot point.

    Defeating specific bosses or reaching strength milestones allows the Vessel to increase its rank within the King's guard.

    World Aesthetics: * Since the kingdom is still intact, platforms and environments are clean and polished rather than overgrown or ruined.

    Scaling Difficulty: * The player starts with higher HP and Attack power than the original Knight.

    To compensate, bosses and enemies deal significantly more damage as the story progresses.

    The Vessel’s defense and attack stats increase automatically during significant story milestones.

    NPC's:
    At the start of the game, citizens of Hallownest appear in one of three states:

    Sick: Suffering from the early stages of the Radiance's infection.

    Scared: NPCs that fear the Vessel and do not engage.

    Hostile: NPCs that attack the Vessel on sight.

    Progression of the Plague: As the story unfolds, more NPCs will shift into the "Sick" state.

    The Honor System: If the player kills non-aggressive or "Sick" civilians, they are penalized by losing 5% of their Geo.

    Boss Encounters
    Molten Mawlek: The first real boss of the game. It is not yet infected but is fused with molten lava. The player must cut connecting tubes to make the Mawlek vulnerable to attack. Defeating it grants the Dash ability, which was fused in the depths of the Mawleks stomache.

    The Soul Architect: The leader of the "soul extraction" project in Hallownest. Killing him angers the Pale King, who was secretly supporting the project (plot)

    The Skygod: A massive deity located at the peak of Hallownest. The battle with this god is what partially destroys the great statue in that area. (SECRET)

    The Hunter: An encounter where you fail to kill the boss; instead, he leaves the Vessel unconscious in a nearby room.

    The First Infected: A forgotten member of the Royal Guard's military who was the first to succumb to the plague. This serves as the mid-game's first infection-based boss fight.

    The Traitor Lord: Encountered in Greenpath. The fight is triggered after the player discovers the hidden motives the Mantis Lords used to exile her and destroy her throne.

    The Pale Court Duel: A high-stakes training duel against the Pale King at the end of the Vessel’s training, occurring immediately after the "Path of Pain" test.

    The Final Boss (Crimson Absolute Radiance): The Absolute Radiance, empowered by a mysterious artifact stolen from a slain god. This artifact turns her attacks red and makes the fight exceptionally difficult.

    Major Plot Elements
    New Areas: While many locations are familiar, they are reworked to look "alive", as the kingdom was still alive at the time. New plot-specific areas are unlocked that contain unique enemies and lore explaining the history of Hallownest.

    The Path of Pain Ending: At the end of the Path of Pain, the cinematic with the Vessel and the Pale King fades to black:
            Before the scene ends, a single word appears on the screen: "Father." This represents the single "instilled thought" that tarnishes the Vessel's purity, eventually allowing the Radiance to escape in the sequal: Hollow Knight
