Game Concept: 1v1 Arena Sword Fighter
Overview

A fast-paced 1v1 2D PvP arena combat game where players engage in sword-based duels across randomly generated maps filled with obstacles, platforms, and power-enhancing objects. The game blends technical melee combat with chaotic map dynamics and a single, high-stakes weapon: the Golden Gun.
Core Mechanics
🗡️ Combat System
Gravity: The higher up you are when you do a ground slam, the more damage you do.

    Health Bar: Each player starts with 100 HP

    Attack Types:

        Forward Slash

        Backward Slash

        Upward Attack (anti-air)

        Down Slam (ground-pound from air)

        Double Jump Slash

    Defensive Moves:

        Block (reduces damage or negates basic attacks)

        Parry (well-timed block that stuns the attacker briefly)

    Combo System:

        String together slashes for light, medium, or heavy combos

        Different combos inflict varying damage (e.g., 5–20 HP per combo depending on hits and timing)

Characters & Abilities

    Multiple unique fighters with different movement speeds, attack speeds, and special abilities (e.g., blink dash, flame sword, slow-motion focus)

    Each ability has a cooldown; abilities synergize with melee attacks

Map & Obstacles

    Every match will consist of 2-5 maps (I don't know how much I'll make).

        Platforms at varying heights

        Spikes or destructible objects

        Falling or moving terrain blocks

    Obstacles can block attacks or force movement strategies

Environmental Boosts

Scattered randomly across the map:

    Jump Pads – Launch players upward or sideways

    Teleport Portals – Instantly move between points

    Speed Boost Zones – Temporarily increase move speed

    Slow Zones – Apply a time-delay field for strategy

    Health Pickups (rare) – Restore a small amount of HP (5–10)

Golden Gun Mechanic

    Located exactly at the center of the map

    One-use per round

    Effect:

        Instantly deals half of the opponent's remaining HP

        If the opponent has ≤10 HP, it deals a finishing 10 damage

    Forces players to control center and manage positioning

Victory Condition

    First player to reduce the other’s HP to 0 wins

    Option for Best of 3 or Sudden Death Mode if tied

    Sudden Death mode: each player is 2 shot no matter what, each given a golden gun and a shield that only works if you click down once when the fire.

    Also a border that slowly shrinks to force fighting and special moves that can do a lot of damage or give buffs to people that use it (character specific).
